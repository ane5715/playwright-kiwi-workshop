    # 10.2. Checked baggage: value stored at step 7

    # https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose
    # The basic assertion "assert total_of_items == total_price_value" would fail because of the way floats are stored.
    # Instead, we can check the absolute difference between the two values is very low, e.g., a bit over 0.01 CZK.

    # Also we can check how relatively distinct the values are:
    # With rel_tol=0.05 the values have to be 5% similar.
    # Here we decided arbitrarily that the values should have rel_tol=0.000000778, i.e., to be 0.00000778% similar.
    assert math.isclose(total_of_items, total_price_value, rel_tol=0.000000778, abs_tol=0.01000000000022)
